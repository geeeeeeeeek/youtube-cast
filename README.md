All this does is provide a form and display the video in an iframe. As of March 26th 2017 you can then follow these steps

1. chromecast [the page](https://greggman.github.io/youtube_chromecast_speed_hack/)
2. enter a youtube url 
3. set the playback speed
4. click the fullscreen icon

Yay! I can watch videos at 1.5x or 2.x speed on my TV!

## Using the bookmarklet

To use the bookmarklet, first add
<a href='javascript:(function () { (window.location.href = \"https://greggman.github.io/youtube_chromecast_speed_hack/?\" + window.location.href) }());'>this link</a>
to your bookmarks.
(You can also add it as a search engine (right-click the toolbar and select `Edit search engines...`).
This allows you to specify a keword (such as `sh`), with which you can easily access the bookmarklet.)
Then on any youtube video page, open the bookmark to automatically apply this hack.
